# letter of request

```
Dear Sir or Madam,
	Moved by the noble cause of Project Hope and encouraged by what has been achieved so far, I would like to contribute my bit to the project by offering financial aid to a child in a remote area of your province
```

```
	I would be very grateful if you could help me seek out a girl who has just started schooling but whose family cannot afford her education
```

```
	My plan is to pay for her tuition on an annual basis until she finishes her secondary education. I would like to remit my donation directly to a bank account opened by her family in her local area.
